# PU_Thesis_NUFFT
This repo accompanies Kaylee Zecchin's math thesis "3D Modeling of Molecular Electron Density Maps Using Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform".

To run the main code, "Thesis_Code_Zecchin.py", store the files "Atomic_Info_dict.txt" and "EASF_Paramters_dict.txt" in the directory you use. Then, from the Protein Data Bank website, https://www.rcsb.org/, download a molecule's PDB formatted file. For ease, the molecule Deoxy Human Hemoglobin PDB file is in this repo as "1a3n.pdb". Store this in your directory to run the given .py file. To run the main file for a different molecule, remember to change the pdb_file parameter.
